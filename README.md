# Game of Life
Based on [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)

This project was made really quickly as a side project, and is not the most efficient. With a higher number of rows and collumns the program struggles to stay above 60 frames per second, but it was fun doing it either way.
